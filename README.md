---------------

## Setup project

**Requirements**

- Git
- Python 3.8 or later.

**Download the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dbetm/spotify-wrapy.git
```

**Move to the repo folder**

```bash
cd spotify-wrapy
```

**Install required Python libraries**

```bash
make install
```

Note: This will create a python virtual environment.

------------------------

## Create my Spotify WraPy video

1) In the folder with your data, look for the files named something like `StreamingHistory.json`. It could be only one, example: `StreamingHistory0.json`.
2) Copy those files and paste them into the `spotify_data/` folder inside the repository.
3) Activate the virtual environment, if you haven't done so already.
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
4) In the command line, run:
```bash
python3 app.py
```
It also supports Spanish language: `python3 app.py --lang spanish`. If this argument is not passed, it will default to English.

Alternatively, you can pass a start and end date to limit the data used, for example:
```bash
python3 app.py --lang english --start-date 2022-01-13 --end-date 2023-01-01
```
If you don't want to generate a video:
```bash
python3 app.py --lang english --no-video
```
5) The results will be saved in a folder (named according to the datetime of execution) inside the [output](output/) folder.


**Important note**: The timestamp provided by Spotify uses UTC time. By default, this project calculates the timezone of the computer it's run on; you can use a different timezone by running:

```bash
python3 app.py --tz America/New_York
```

You can find the list of timezones at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
